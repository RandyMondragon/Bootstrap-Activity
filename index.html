        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. My name is Randy Mondragon and I am a full time student here at CSULB. With the end of the 2021 semester coming up, I will have finished my second year attending CSULB.

I was born and raised here in Long Beach, and have a single mom and an older brother, whom were born in Mexico, as well as a younger brother. I'm a first generation college student being the first in my family to attend college and hope to excel in this field of Computer Science. I'm 19 years old currently working at Papa Johns as a delivery driver, living at home. I also have a girlfriend of 8 months, which I hope to move out with within a year which is what I'm currently saving all my money for. Some of my interests/hobbies include video games, going to the gym, skating, listening to music, watching movies and anime.</p>
